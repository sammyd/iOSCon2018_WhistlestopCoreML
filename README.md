# A whistlestop tour of Core ML

This repo accompanies a talk presented at iOSCon 2018.

There are two sample iOS apps, demonstrating the use of Core ML:

- __MovieRater__ uses an SVM trained on the polarity_dataset_v2.0 available from https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/
- __Subitizer__ uses the pre-trained CNN-based model to estimate the number of salient objects in a photo.

In addition there are jupyter notebooks that are used to build the Core ML models before importing in the iOS apps.
